step 1:
    initializing a git repository
    $ git init

    checking the status of the repository
    $ git status 
    it tells about what changes you made which are not tracked

    adding new files which were not added or any other changes
    $ git add {filename, dir}

    commiting to the repository
    $ git commit -m "the message regarding the changes"

    removing something from status which will not be commited
    $ git restore --stageed notes.txt
